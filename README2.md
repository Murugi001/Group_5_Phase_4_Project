# PROJECT OVERVIEW
# FROM TWEETS TO STRATEGY: PREDICTING SENTIMENT AND SHARING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT  

## 📌 Business Understanding

## 📂Data Understanding
- The dataset used in this project was sourced from Data World and contributed by Kent Cavender-Bares on August 30, 2013. It consists of 9,093 entries containing crowd-sourced sentiment assessments of tweets mentioning different brands and products. Each record includes the original tweet, a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), and, when relevant, the specific brand or product associated with the sentiment. Annotators evaluated not only whether a sentiment was present but also its intended target, making this dataset a valuable resource for studying public perception, brand engagement, and emotional tone on social media.

## 📂 Data Preprocessing  
Missing Values; Filled missing product references with a placeholder token ("No_Target") & Dropped rows with empty tweets or missing sentiment labels
Categorical Standardization; Unified sentiment labels into three categories: positive, negative, neutral 
Text Cleaning; Converted all tweet text to lowercase & Removed URLs, mentions (@user), hashtags, numbers, and special characters
Tokenization & Stopword Removal; Split cleaned text into tokens & Removed common stopwords to reduce noise.
Feature Transformation; Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features for model training.
